In the rare occasion that somebody wants to do something that is actually dangerous, we ask them to stop. If they are planning something unreasonably risky, we help them find something equally fun that is acceptably safe.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Our secondary job is to interpret BBYO policy – for example: we decide how many staff they actually need for a given event based on what they have planned.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Our third job, and the one we probably enjoy the most and spend the most time on, is to be available for general advice. Whether it is about chapter issues or programs, school, or anything else, one of us is almost always available to chat either at an event, by phone, or online.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Occasionally we answer parents’ questions about the chapter – though it’s often difficult to convey to them how much their sons stand to gain by participating in AZA. So if you’re a parent who wants to know more about that, you might want to chat with the parents of some of our alumni. We’ll be glad to introduce you.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Ramon AZA currently has three advisors with a combined experience of over 40 years advising. Yet the chapter still has the ability to surprise us. That’s ok – because every day we see Alephs surprised at what they can accomplish as well.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h1>\r\n        Other Information\r\n    </h1>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Here's a link to the <a href=\"/files/chapter_decision_making_flowchart.pdf/\">parliamentary procedure flowchart</a> as currently practiced in the chapter.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>",

  "content": "<div class=\"spotlight\">\r\n    <h1>The AZA Story</h1>\r\n    <h3>As written in the 6th edition of the Traditions Packet</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n        In 1923 there was a group of 15 Jewish teens who wanted to join their school’s fraternity, the Alpha Zeta Alpha. The fraternity would not let them join because they were Jewish. They decided that they would protest the Greek system and start a Jewish fraternity using Hebrew letters. From this point on, they would be the Aleph Zadik Aleph. At first, the letters had no meaning. Two years later, when the Aleph Zadik Aleph for Young Men was adopted by B’nai B’rith, the name was interpreted to represent the motto of the sponsoring organization. The first Aleph was to stand for Ahavah, brotherly love; Zadik, T’zedakah, benevolence; the second Aleph, Achdoos, harmony. This first group would be known as Mother Chapter #1. Abe Baboir was elected as the Aleph Zadik Aleph’s first president and Nathan Mnookin would be the fraternity’s first advisor.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        A few months after the fraternity was started, Mnooking moved to Kansas City where he started another chapter of this fraternity. The men of Mother Chapter #1 asked Sam Beber to be their next advisor. Beber had many dreams for the fraternity. He saw the fraternity spreading throughout the U.S. and the world. His idea was to have an unmistakably Jewish fraternity. Sam Beber is now regarded as the founder of the Aleph Zadik Aleph.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        On May 3, 1924, at a meeting at Harry Lapidus’s house, a constitution was drawn up and the Aleph Zadik Aleph was officially established. At the same meeting, the Supreme Advisory Council was started as the policy-making body of the fraternity.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        During July 4-6 1924, the first National Convention of the Aleph Zadik Aleph was held at the JCC in Omaha, Nebraska. At this time, there were four chapters: Mother Chapter AZA #1 in Omaha, Nebraska: AZA #2 in Kansas City, Kansas; AZA #3 in Lincoln, Nebraska; and AZA #4 in Des Moines, Iowa. Two thirds of the membership (94 people) came for a weekend of brotherhood and friendship. There was a deadlock for the Grand Aleph Godol race between Charles Shane and William Horowitz. Eventually, the decision was turned over to the Supreme Advisory Council and, on the fact that Shane was 20 and Horowitz was only 17, Shane became the first Grand Aleph Godol and Horowitz the first Grand Aleph S’gan.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        At the 1925 B’nai B’rith International Convention, Henry Monsky presented a petition to get the Aleph Zadik Aleph adopted by B’nai B’rith. Of course the petition was accepted, and the Aleph Zadik Aleph was now the junior order of B’nai B’rith.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        In 1926, at the second International Convention, Philip Klutznick was elected as the second Grand Aleph Godol. After his term, Klutznick became the International Director of AZA; he would later go on to serve as President of B’nai B’rith, US Ambassador to the UN, Chairman of the World Jewish Congress, and Secretary of Commerce under the Carter administration. Also in 1925, AZA went international, establishing the first Canadian chapter in Calgary, Alberta, and the Shofar, the official AZA newspaper, was created. In 1928, Dr. Boris D. Bogen presented his Five-Fold-and-Full plan, which developed the five folds of AZA: athletic, social, educational, community service/social action, and Judaic programming. The five folds have been used ever since as categories under which events may fall.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Despite the crippling Greate Depression, the AZA managed to continue to grow. After 10 years (in 1933), AZA had 100 chapters in North America. However, one of the most tragic events in the history of the order happened in 1932: Harry Lapidus, former treasurer of the Supreme Advisory Council, was assassinated. The Lapidus Memorial Forest in Palestine was established in his memory. In 1936, the first European chapter was created in Sofia, Bulgaria. It was called Karmen Chapter. In 1938, the first Middle Eastern chapter opened in Tel Aviv.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        In the forties, AZA mobilized for war. Massive war support efforts of dollars and man-hours were contributed by AZA. Over 10,000 members and alumni served in the Canadian and US armed forces, and as many as 250 were reported killed. As a result, the minimum age of membership was lowered from 16 to 14. In 1944, B’nai B’rith Girls was officially recognized and BBYO was born. On November 10, 1944, the Supreme Advisory Council was replaced by the BBYO Commission, with Henry Monsky as its first chairman.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        On the Silver Anniversary of AZA (1949), the order had about 420 chapters worldwide. The fifties held a time of great prosperity for BBYO just as it did for the rest of the US. The fraternity focused more and more on the leadership aspect, establishing International Kallah, ILTC, and ISI programs.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        In 2002, BBYO Inc. split from B’nai B’rith and became an independent corporation.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        When the Golden Anniversary of AZA took place in 1974, BBYO was at its height, with over 40,000 members worldwide. New programs, such as CLTC, had been created, and new regions of the world had enjoyed their first taste of BBYO. Noar Lenoar, the counterpart of BBYO in Israel, had been established.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        BBYO’s membership declined following its height in the 70’s. Membership decreased to just over 15,000 in 2005. Although membership has decreased, BBYO is certainly not down-and-out. The many teens that now belong to the order experience the same feeling of brotherhood that those 15 boys felt 95 years ago when AZA was born.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>",

Refer to here to see what board positions there are and their individual responsibilities. Getting elected to a certain position means the chapter trusts whoever got elected to not only fulfill their responsibility, but to do the best they can with that position.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2>Why you should go:</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Chapter elections, unlike country elections, have less people voting, and more competent candidates. Your vote really does count, as many board positions have been decided over one vote. That being said, it’s your vote going to decide who is next going to lead the chapter and have it accomplish bigger and better things. Going also shows that you support your brother Alephs in their wins – and their losses.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        To qualify to vote/run you need to be signed up on b-linked and fully paid for your membership. If you’re an eighth grader, you need to promise to pay as soon as you can and have an account on b-linked.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2>Fraternity:</h2>\r\n    <p>Elections are often quoted as being the “most unfraternal event of each term”. That is because it is a time where the chapter comes together and chooses one Aleph over another. This is almost always avoided, but elections is the time where it’s unavoidable. In order to minimize the unfraternalness before and during elections, many things occur:</p>\r\n    <ul style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n        <li>\r\n            <h2>Before elections:</h2>\r\n            <ul style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n                <li>\r\n                    If you want to run for something, do not, I repeat, DO NOT, tell anyone in the chapter besides for the Gadol, past gadol (Kohen Gadol or previous), or an advisor of our chapter (Check the board pages to see who those people are. Telling someone else about what you are running for outside that list of people is considered politicking, and depending on the severity, will get you to be not allowed to run for that position.\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    Do not try to figure out with your brother Alephs who is going to run for what. Doing that has the chances of spreading wrong information, which may cause people to feel pressured to run for something they don’t want to, or for someone to stop running for something they do want to.\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    If you need to use an example when talking about elections, always use “Aleph X” in place of where you would normally put a person. Example: “Let’s say Aleph X wants to run for moreh….”\r\n                </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <h2>During Elections:</h2>\r\n            <ul style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n                <li>\r\n                    Don’t talk to people who just ran about why they won or why they lost. The only things that should be said to the running candidates is something positive that either congratulates or cheers them up.\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    While running for a position, every person gets the same amount of time to speak. That way the Alephs can hear each person equally and will judge solely on who they think deserves the position. The time abstract example apa allotted for speeches depends on the position. People running for Gadol get 5 minutes, Sgan and Moreh 4 minutes, and every other position 3 minutes.\r\n                </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h2>Running for a position:</h2>\r\n    <ul style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n        <li>\r\n            <h2>Choosing which position:</h2>\r\n            <ul style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n                <li>\r\n                    In order to run for a position, you need to first figure out what position you want. While technically, everyone is allowed to run for anything (except for Kohen Gadol), it’s generally advised for younger members to stay away from the more taxing positions (ex. Gadol, Sgan), and to run for things that doesn’t require much experience to fulfill, but has a lot of room for people to do things beyond the position itself (ex. Historian Shotare, Katav, Machshev).\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    If you can’t figure out what position to run for, but still want to be on board, talk to one of the advisors. They can help guide you into a position that you’ll be able to do.\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    Let’s say you want to run for a position, but think that the responsibility will be too much for you alone to handle. Something you can do is run with a counterpart (abbreviated as Co). Doing that will have the position be held in both of your names, and have the responsibility go to both of you.\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    In order to get a Co, you need to talk to the gadol, any previous gadol, or an advisor. They’ll be able to set you up with your person of preference (assuming they also want to run for that), or someone else who also wants to run for the same position. Do NOT talk to the person you want to be in a Co with directly, as that will count as politicking. Once you are given a Co by one of the aforementioned people, you can freely discuss with your Co about speech topics and plans for that board position.\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    Once you figured out what position you want to run for, although not necessary, it is highly advised to tell an advisor or the godol about it.\r\n                </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <h2>Preparing for Elections:</h2>\r\n            <ul style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n                <li>\r\n                    To run, it is best to write out a speech highlighting your qualifications for the position, and what you will do if elected to that position. The speech should cover what project(s) you want to execute, how you will achieve that, and any other things that you feel are important for the chapter to know when it comes to voting for you in that position. Many speeches incorporate an idea/life lesson as an overall theme. How you write it is completely up to you, but be mindful of your positions time limit on speeches (5 min for Gadol, 4 min for Sgan and Moreh, 3 min for everything else).\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    It is also advised to prepare speeches for positions lower than yours to “run down.”  Do this so you can have a chance to still have a position if you don’t get the one you wanted.\r\n                </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</div>",

DON'T DO THAT, try to give yourself at least an hour, you know? Oh, and make sure you have all of the necessary materials (there is a chapter event budget, but you need to get that approved)\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2>Step 5: The Event!</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Literally a hang out event is considered awesome, programming is an added bonus, basically anything you will do will be made super awesome because of the amount of super cool alephs there to support you.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>",

The official BBYO definition for them are as follows:\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li><strong style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Athletics</strong>: Sports in AZA have always been vital to the building of brotherhood and fraternity. Many councils and regions throughout the Order compete in several different sports. Not only do AZA chapters among the Order compete in sporting events, but also participate in games and athletic-based programming.</li>\r\n            <li><strong style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Community Service/Social Action</strong>: In accordance with Jewish tradition, AZA emphasizes the values of tikkun olam (repairing the world) and tzedakah (charity). Community service can entail a wide range of hands-on activities that involve direct service to those in need. Social action involves mobilizing and educating members to address problems that exist in society, and it requires a group not only to learn about these issues, but also to do something about them. AZA encourages members to take an active role in the community around them.</li>\r\n            <li><strong style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Education</strong>: Through AZA, Alephs are challenged to learn about things beyond themselves and the borderlines of our Jewish faith. Through educational programming teens learn material that broaden our knowledge and give each individual Aleph a new understanding about the world around them. Education also entails teaching members the traditions of AZA.</li>\r\n            <li><strong style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Judaic</strong>: Judaic programs bring a unique, spiritual aspect to life in AZA, seeking to develop an understanding of, and appreciation for, the religion and culture of the Jewish people. Through programming in the Judaic fold, we not only learn about our denomination of Judaism, but also about the ones around us, and about the branches that other members practice. Also, creative Jewish programs incorporate the popular culture of today, as well as traditional Jewish rituals.</li>\r\n            <li><strong style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Social</strong>: AZA chapters sponsor and participate in a wide variety of social programs, often with BBG chapters. While there is nothing wrong with simple social programming, it is important to be creative and use the fold in the proper proportion and to combine this with other folds for effective, meaningful programming.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2 name=\"7_cards\">The 7 Cardinal Principles</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        The 7 cardinal principles of AZA, often referred to as the 7 cards, are essentially the basic values of AZA. The official BBYO definitions for them are as follows:\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li><strong style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Patriotism</strong>: Loyalty to my homeland, to its laws, to it's principles, to its ethics. To die for it if need be, but primarily to live for it.</li>\r\n            <li><strong style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Judaism</strong>: Always to observe the tenets of my faith; ever to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with the lord my G-d.</li>\r\n            <li><strong style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Filial Love</strong>: Ever to honor and love my parents. To be considerate of my elders and to respect age.</li>\r\n            <li><strong style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Charity</strong>: To give of myself and my substance for all worthy causes; to be kind and generous to all in need, regardless of race or color.</li>\r\n            <li><strong style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Conduct</strong>: Never too bold, never too forward, ever humble, ever observing the principles of gentlemen.</li>\r\n            <li><strong style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Purity</strong>: To keep my soul pure, my mind active, and my body healthy.</li>\r\n            <li><strong style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Fraternity</strong>: A spirit of sociability, of cooperation, and of friendship toward all AZA's that shall make of us one fellowship; a love of and a loyalty to AZA and it's Ideals.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>",

While dealing with the pressures of school and social groups, teens are expected to make mature decisions with limited life experience. AZA is at your side to help Jewish parents raise confident, engaged and well-prepared teenagers. Now, more than ever, our programs provide innovative opportunities and a stress-free environment that not only allows teens to customize their own experience but that also grows with them to accommodate their changing needs.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        How does AZA provide such a unique experience?\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>By providing safe and enriching programs that the teens design themselves, fostering independent thinking and leadership abilities that will help prepare them for college and other adult endeavors.</li>\r\n            <li>By bringing together thousands of Jewish teens from all over the world, from the most traditional to non-practicing Jewish backgrounds, to share experiences that build character as they build friendships for life.</li>\r\n            <li>By exposing teens to Jewish culture, history and practice, and introducing new ways to help them apply Jewish principles to contemporary life and that encourage them to determine for themselves what being a Jew means.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        AZA offers a time-tested model for leadership development. Teens are given real responsibilities and develop leadership skills that relate to their everyday lives. By practicing public speaking, program planning, community organizing and managing people, AZA teens build skills that not only make them more confident and capable of navigating the challenging teen years, but also prepare them to make positive contributions to the world around them as adults.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        As well as being a fun and productive environment, AZA is a completely safe environment for all Jewish teens to be accepted regardless of their background. We have a strict zero-tolerance rule against any and all drugs and alcohol. In addition, violence is prohibited. Everyone in AZA is treated with respect and are not peer-pressured into things, making it the ideal environment for a Jewish teen.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2 name=\"contact\">Parents, Contact Us!</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Hello, {% if single %} I am {% else %} we are {% endif %} {{ metaksher }}, and {% if single %} I am the metaksher {% else %} we are the co-metaksherim {% endif %} for this term. {% if single %}I am{% else %}We are{% endif %} in charge of our parent and alumni relations, and can be contacted through the chapter email account: <a href=\"mailto:ramon195aza@gmail.com\">ramon195aza@gmail.com</a>. <a href=\"/board_pages/aleph_metaksher/\">{% if single %}My{% else %}Our{% endif %} board page</a> contains more information on {% if single %}me, my goals, and my{% else %}us, our goals, and our{% endif %} contact information.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>",

We were founded on October 28, 1991, and have been going strong ever since.
